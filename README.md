# Project-1

For Unit 8 assignment.

Explanation as to why I didn't finish my part of Project 1:

First, I really don't have a complete grasp of jQuery. To be honest, whenever we have pre-class drills, or an In-Class assignment where I have to "fill in the blanks," I just stare at the code without a clue how to start anything from scratch. Even with my homework, I just have no idea how to create anything out of thin air, and often have to resort to searching online for anything code resembling what might be necessary to any assignment.
If I had known from the beginning that all the necessary code for everything was available in the In-Class assignments, I know I would have been better off. But I guess I didn't know that in the first few weeks. And so I was always scrambling to find any comprehensible code from the internet. (Sorry--this is going to be a long-winded ReadMe.)
So I feel like I've fallen behind trying to catch up--especially when we started jQuery and Ajax calls and APIs, etc.
And when my Firebase assignment didn't work, I felt REALLY behind.

Second, when my group parsed out assignments, Blaine took the HTML/CSS jobs--and SOLELY HTML/CSS jobs. If I could have just done HTML/CSS, I would have killed that! So unfortunately, I was stuck with creating a "Things to Do" page. And the idea behind the "Things to Do" page was supposed to be if you were traveling to a certain city and found your hotel, the "Things to Do" page would find places/activities near your hotel. (Coffee, beerpub, swimming, etc.)
We all agreed that triposo.com seemed to be best for this as it had a lot of detail in its searches. BUT it didn't have a "city" search, strangely enough. (It had "country codes" and it seemed to be European-based.)
Then Garry showed me tomtom.com. Same kind of deal. Detailed searches but it also didn't have a "city" search.
But both triposo.com and tomtom.com had "latitude" and "longitude" searches. (Puzzled face.) And I knew that no user out there in the world was going to do a search by lat./long. (BTW, I wasn't willing to use Google as Google would have cost money to use their API.)
Greg showed me OpenCageData.com (his code is in the "gregs-APIKey.js" file), which had an API which could convert a "city" search into a lat./long., and vice versa. 
Well, my knowledge of jQuery was definitely not extensive enough to be able to use the OpenCageData API to tell the Triposo/TomTom API what to do. (I don't even know how to manipulate the jQuery code to create a div and output for the search results.)

Well, anyway, my APIKey from tomtom.com is in the "my-APIKey.js" file, and my "things-to-do.js" file is incomplete because I asked Garry for his code for his "grub (things to eat)" JS file and tried to change it to fit my search--and there might be some old Triposo links on it. I just had no idea what to put in my "things-to-do.js" file and had no idea how the code worked.

Anyway, sorry for this long-winded ReadMe. Hope everyone else in the group does well.
