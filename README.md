You're an avid hiker at home. But when you're traveling, how do you find trails to hike when you're visiting a new destination?
Let the On the Beaten Path app help you find those trails--so you can do what you love: Get hiking!

On the "Trail Search" input line, you can simply type in the city and state of your destination, or the zip code--or you can simply 
type in the name of a mountain or park you are visiting. 
Click the "Let's Go Hiking!" button and the On the Beaten Path app will search for hiking trails in the nearby area! 
The app will also give a brief summary about each trail, along with the length of each trail and the current weather and conditions
of each trail.

So get your trail search going--and GET HIKING!
